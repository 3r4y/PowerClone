PowerClone script to download all repositories of a specified GitHub user to your local machine. 

I created a simple PowerShell script called PowerClone. This script doesn't have a lot of functionality by itself, but when combined with other tools, it becomes very powerful. PowerClone allows you to download all repositories of a specified GitHub user to your local machine

## maybe i will add it later ðŸ˜¬
* download projects starred by specific users

## Setup

```
download the repo, change the $username in main.ps1 and run it.
```
